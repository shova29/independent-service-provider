          <p>
            I spent a week on the Treshnish Isles, a small offshore island
            photographing a range of different seabird species. My main target
            was the Puffin, these birds can be very tame and confiding and after
            spending some time with them I can see why it is one of the nationâ€™s
            favourite birds. I took over 2000 images of puffins in flight but
            only a small percentage were in focus as they are so fast in flight.
            This one was heading straight towards its burrow with its catch to
            feed its young chick. It is my all time favourite image.
